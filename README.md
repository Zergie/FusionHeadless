# FusionHeadless
**FusionHeadless** is a developer-focused add-in for Autodesk Fusion 360 that launches a local REST server, allowing you to run arbitrary Python code (via `eval()` or `exec()`) against the Fusion API in real time.  Ideal for automation, testing, and headless control of your Fusion instance from external scripts or systems.
